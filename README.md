# DISCORD BOT

## Introduction

This is my first test about creating an admin bot via Discord platform ðŸš€

## Functions

There are many basic functions of a Discord Bot such as: \
     â€¢ Reply when catching a keyword \
     â€¢ Delete users' messages \
     â€¢ Display users' ping \
Besides, by calling API from `brainshop.ai`, all users in Discord server can communicate with my bot like a person!
